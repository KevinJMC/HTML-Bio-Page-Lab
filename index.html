        <h2>The Man, The Mystery</h2>
        
        <p>It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents â€” except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.</p>
        
        <p>No, but seriously, I grew up all across the country. I love being outdoors, and I love being on a computer. I used to work in restaurants as a server and a bartender, but now I'm training to be a developer.</p>
